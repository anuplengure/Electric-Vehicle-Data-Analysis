# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis (  Tableau )
## Project Objective 
To analyze and visualize electric vehicle (EV) data across the United States using Tableau, with the goal of identifying key trends by model year, state, manufacturer, and EV type, and to provide actionable insights that support sustainable transportation policies and strategic business decisions.

## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/anuplengure/Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.zip">Electric Vehicle Population Data</a>

##  KPI’s  Requirements

•	Total Vehicles

•	Average Electric Range

•	Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles

•	Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles

## Charts Requirements

•	Total Vehicles by Model Year( From 2010 onwards) : Line / Area chart

•	Total Vehicles by State : Map

•	Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make : Bar chart

•	Total Vehicles by  Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle(CAFV) Eligibility: Donut chart

•	Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model :  Tree Map


## Process

•	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies , and sort out the same.

•	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.

•	Created calculated fields and parameters.

•	Applied data source filter, context filter, dimension filter etc.

•	Built an interactive dashboard using  all sheets.

## Project Insight

•	Total Electric Vehicles analysed : 130,816, with 80.2% BEVs and 19.8% PHEVs.

•	Average electric range across all vehicles: 73.10 miles.

•	Significant growth in EV adoption observed post-2017, peaking in 2022 (23.6K vehicles).

•	Tesla dominates the market with over 52.7% share, followed by Nissan (10.3%) and Chevrolet (9.2%).

•	Top EV models: Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3, and Nissan Leaf together make up over 50% of total vehicles.

•	Washington(WA)  leads EV adoption among U.S. states.

•	Over 42.75% of vehicles are CAFV eligible.

## Recommendations

•	Policy makers should focus on expanding EV incentives and infrastructure in high-growth states like California and Washington.

•	EV companies should prioritize service and compatibility with Tesla and Nissan vehicles due to their market dominance.

•	Charging infrastructure providers should expand networks in states with high BEV density and recent growth (2020–2022).

•	Promote CAFV eligibility awareness to encourage more consumers to purchase compliant vehicles and claim benefits.

•	Monitor recent adoption dips (2023) for policy changes or data collection delays before forecasting future demand.
